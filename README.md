# PrefVote

PrefVote is a project to promote use and understanding of preference voting methods and algorithms. It is derived from the Vote::STV software written by Ian Kluft in Perl originally in 1999.

Since the project's original language Perl has strengths in prototyping, it's the reference implementation in this project for multiple language implementations. With translations to multiple programming languages, the library is intended to have a common [test suite](test/) among the different implementations to verify proper functioning.

## About preference voting algorithms

The original Vote::STV software implemented the [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) algorithm, which is a subset of [ranked-choice voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting).

STV ws the first implemented voting method in PrefVote since it was the original implementation as Vote::STV back to 1998. But STV has largely fallen out of favor because studies of voting methods found it lacking on some desirable characteristics. STV was retained while modernizing the code to develop testing infrastructure.

 While no voting method is perfect, methods which meet Condorcet requirements are among the best around. So the second voting method implemented in PrefVote was the [Schulze algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) (see [full definition paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02973). Next up will be [Ranked Pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs).

After the reference implementation in Perl, next up for language implementations will be [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Example voting result from test suite

This is an example result from Single Transferable Vote (STV) and Schulze using the same [file in the test suite](test/inputs/100-rcv-test/004-rcv-test.yaml) with each algorithm. 250 ballots were randomly generated. So there's no actual meaning to the result except testing the software.

Notes about all the following examples:

- Candidate names are fictitious, just to get names that start with A, B, C, D, E and F as used universally throughout the test suite. The names are whimsical based on the difficult dilemma voters sometimes feel they are choosing between in real candidates.

- Even for a relatively small set of test data, this shows the importance of algorithm definition to handling of ranked-choice votes. The various algorithms can lead to different results following procedures that can vary in behavior when vote counts are close. This example was one where a close race came out differently.

Notes about the STV example:

- In the Single Transferable Vote (STV) method used in this example, each round proceeds by either selecting winners who are above the quota of available votes, or eliminating the last-place candidate(s) and transferring those votes to the next choice on each ballot that had them. When a candidate wins, the fraction of their votes beyond the quota necessary to win also transfer to other candidates.

- The "Result" column shows a numerical place and disposition. The disposition will be one of
  
  - "selected" if the candidate/choice placed high enough to win an available seat
  
  - "tied" if a tie exists between multiple candidates and spans through at least one available seat and more than can be filled. It is the software's role to report this, not to decide what to do. Ties can and do happen. So an organization must have procedures to deal with them.
  
  - "placed" if the candidate placed after the last available seat, and therefore was not selected/elected.
  
  - "eliminated" if the candidate was eliminated from counting. A place number reflects order where the first or strongest elimination is ordered last.

Notes about the Schulze example:

- The Schulze method is a Condorcet voting method. So it aggregates the ranked preferences from each ballot into total occurrences of preference of each pair of candidates. In all Condorcet methods, if one candidate is preferred over all others then it is the winner. The Schulze method also considers paths of preferences in a graph to pick between candidates when there isn't a single Condorcet winner.

- As with the STV results, the first table in the example is the final ranking order of the voting results. It indicates selected, tied, and placed candidates as above. There is no concept of eliminated candidates in the Schulze method. After the winner is found in each round, the vote is re-run for as many rounds as needed until all the candidates are ordered in the result.

- The margin-of-victory matrix shows the voting results with how much each candidate on the row labels are preferred over candidates on the column labels. Negative numbers mean the other candidate is more preferred. There is a "not applicable" icon in each cell diagonally down the middle where each candidate cannot be compared to themselves. The matrix always has an inverse symmetry because the same pair of candidates compared on the other side of the diagonal will be opposite - with A-B vs B-A, one of them must negative and opposite of the other. A Condorcet winner is easily visible as having all positive numbers (and check-mark icons) compared against all other candidates.
