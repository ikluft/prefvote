# PrefVote

PrefVote is a project to promote use and understanding of preference voting methods and algorithms. It is derived from the Vote::STV software written by Ian Kluft in Perl originally in 1999.

Since the project's original language Perl has strengths in prototyping, it's the reference implementation in this project for multiple language implementations. With translations to multiple programming languages, the library is intended to have a common test suite among the different implementations to verify proper functioning.

## About preference voting algorithms

The original Vote::STV software implemented the [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) algorithm, which is a subset of [ranked-choice voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting).
