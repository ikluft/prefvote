julien@condorcet.vote , signature:55073db57b0a859911 || Candidate A > Candidate B > Candidate C # Same as above, so there will be 43 votes with this ranking. And tags are registered by the software if able.
Candidate C > Candidate A = Candidate B ^7 * 8 # 8 votes with a weight of 7.
Candidate B = Candidate A > Candidate C
Candidate C # Interpreted as Candidate C > Candidate A = Candidate B, because implicit ranking is true (which is also default, but it's better to say it)
Candidate B > Candidate C # Interpreted as Candidate B > Candidate C
