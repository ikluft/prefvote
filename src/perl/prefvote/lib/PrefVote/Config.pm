=head1 NAME

PrefVote::Config - configuration singleton class for PrefVote hierarchy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PrefVote::Config;

    my $config_ref = PrefVote::Config->instance());

=head1 DESCRIPTION

â›” This is for PrefVote internal use only.

PrefVote::Config maintains a singleton configuration for the PrefVote class hierarchy.

Since the top-level PrefVote class provides this to the entire hierarchy, do not use this class directly.
Use any relevant subclass of PrefVote instead.

=head2 RECOGNIZED CONFIGURATIONS

The following configutation strings are recognized. Subclasses may define more of their own.
All configuration entries default to non-existent and undefined.

=over 1

=item no-tiebreak

If defined, this contains a boolean flag that inhibits the PrefVote system's use of L<PrefVote::Core>
"average choice rank" (ACR) data for tie-breaking. This is recognized by L<PrefVote::STV>, L<PrefVote::Schulze> and
L<PrefVote::RankedPairs>.

=item input-ties

(experimental)
If defined, this contains a boolean flag that enables input ties in the format of "A/B" to indicate a voter cast
an equal tied vote between two choices.
This is recognized by L<PrefVote::Core> and inherited by all other voting methods.
It does not affect L<PrefVote::Schulze> which sets input ties on by its definition.
The STV and RankedPairs code currently does not expect input ties to occur, and currently will fail when it is set
and any input-tied votes are received.
