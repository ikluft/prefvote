=head1 NAME

PrefVote::Core::Result - internal voting-result structure used by PrefVote::Core

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PrefVote::Core::Result;
    use Set::Tiny;

    $result = PrefVote::Core::Result->new(type => $type, name => set(@names);

    $count = $result->name_count();
    $empty = $result->name_empty();
    @cand = $result->name_all();
    $type = $result->type();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

â›” This is for PrefVote internal use only.

PrefVote::Core::Result is used to store results of L<PrefVote::Core::Round> structures for voting methods which use rounds, including STV and Schulze.

The result of the round is recorded with the name field containing a L<Set::Tiny> of strings with candidate/choice names. The type parameter is an enumeration with either of the strings "winner" or "eliminated". A PrefVote::Core::Result shoild not be created in a PrefVote::Core::Round if there was no result in the round.
