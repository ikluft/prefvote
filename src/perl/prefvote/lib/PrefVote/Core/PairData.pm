=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use PrefVote::Core::PairData;
  my $pairdata_ref = PrefVote::Core::PairData->new();

  $pairdata_ref->add_preference(1);
  my $count = $pairdata_ref->preference();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

â›” This is for PrefVote internal use only.

A PrefVote::Core:PairData object contains data pertaining to a pair of candidates.
It serves as a base class for more specific PairData classes in Condorcet voting methods.
Outside the scope of this class, L<PrefVote::Core::PairMatrix> has a sparse table (two-level hash) of the
candidates being compared: candidate 1 (represented by the outer hash) and candidate 2 (inner hash).
An instance of this object is contained within each entry of that table.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Attributes include accessor methods of the same name. With no parameter, it gets the value.
With a parameter it sets the value.

=over 1

=item preference

Integer tally of the votes cast which favor Candidate 1 over Candidate 2.
It does not contain votes the opposite direction, Candidate 2 over Candidate 1.
If those votes exist, they are tallied in the appropriate cell in the table
for Candidate 2 against Candidate 1, the opposite order of this cell.

=head1 METHODS

=over 1

=item add_preference(n)

This method adds n votes to the tally in the preference attribute, first initializing it to zero if it didn't exist.
